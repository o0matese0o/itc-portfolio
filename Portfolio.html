                    <h4>Computer Science as Discipline</h4>
                </div>
                
                <h5>Definition</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>A new species of non-physical science, distinct from social science or mathematics but rather a sui generis (“of its own kind”) among the sciences (Hartmanis, 1993, as cited in Rapaport, 2017)</li>
                    <li>It is “to capture the messy complexity of the natural world and express it algorithmically” (Nakra, quoted in Davidson, 2006)</li>
                    <li>A study of discrete behavior exhibited by interacting information-processing agents like computers or humans differentiates it from physics (Baeten and Sangiorgi, 2014). Hence, the demarcation of computer science involves discrete mathematics (algebra, logic), interactions (between agents or with the world), and information (processing and transmission)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h5>Subfields</h5>
                <p class="paragraph1">12 distinct subfields under the discipline (Denning, 1999):</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Algorithms & Data Structures</li>

                    <li>Computational Science</li>
                    <li>Organizational Informatics</li>
                    <li>Bioinformatics</li>
                </ol>

                <h5>Application</h5>
                <p class="paragraph3">It has a wide range of applications such as simulating climate change and diseases, creating art through graphics rendering, and developing human-like interfaces with AI and machine learning (Belford and Tucker, 2024).</p>

                    <h4>Analysis/Reaction</h4>
                </div>
                <p class="paragraph3">Showcasing the introduction of the course, Introduction to Computing (ITC) allowed me to recall, elaborate, and evaluate my prior knowledge of what the course could offer as part of the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS) curriculum. The first five (5) topics are entitled “Computer Science as a Discipline,” “Computing Disciplines and Major,” “IT People and Careers,” “Information Systems: Concepts and Definitions,” and “Computers and Their Uses,” respectively. The main objective was to learn and differentiate the components of each topic, ensuring a comprehensive understanding over time as the knowledge gained in this course will also be useful in the other CIS courses.</p>
                <p class="paragraph3">When these topics were presented, the first description that I thought of was the purpose of computing. Courses in Secondary school touched on computers to relate this to various subjects such as science, computer, empowerment technologies, and media and information literacy. The term translates to a large scope of interconnected systems that lead to a global connection that drives the modern world. As most of my previous instructors mentioned, computing encompasses a broad range of applications that currently impact every aspect of our lives. Accordingly, this was not new to me, although this time around, the course ITC is dealing with the topic properly and not with the limit of its relation to other subject matter. Before, the practice I did to guide my learning was to self-evaluate with the help of materials recommended or provided by instructors. A part of it was to relate it to what I can observe in the present time. I encountered a few misconceptions on the topic, which is computing only being centered on mathematics. Its scale was also not something I could estimate, given that it pushes the boundaries of human knowledge to everyday conveniences like shopping and communication, serving as a backbone of innovation.</p>
                <p class="paragraph3">The class discussion on the 27th and 29th of August 2024 was informative as the PowerPoint (PPT) presentation was brief and concise along with the relatable additional information provided by Ms. Navarrete. When making the portfolio, it surely tested my understanding of the different disciplines of computing given that most intersect with some computing topics. Fortunately, I managed to clear things up by researching and reading the notes provided to aid me in understanding the topic better and also prepare me for an upcoming quiz. After completing the task, I developed a deeper appreciation for the diversity within the field of computing. I gained insight into the origins of each computing discipline and how they contribute unique solutions to various problems through computational methods. Computing transforms not just me but all its practitioners in the way we learn in school, do our jobs, and connect with the world. It fosters a mindset of problem-solving and innovation, encouraging us to think critically and creatively. Through computing, we not only gain technical skills but also develop a deeper understanding of collaboration, ethics, and the ever-evolving landscape of human knowledge as it opens a myriad of possibilities.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Data</b> is commonly considered 'raw' or unorganized data, a collection of text, numbers, and symbols without meaning (Cambridge International Examinations, 2015). It needs to be processed or placed within a specific context</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>When data is processed, typically by a computer, it transforms into <b>information</b>. This information consists of facts that give context and significance to the processed data, making it a meaningful and useful context (Cambridge International Examinations, 2015)</li>
                    <li>An organized collection of data that can be understood (Laudon, 1996)</li>

                <p class="paragraph3">The second (2nd) portfolio of the course, "Introduction to Computing" (ITC), focuses on the discipline of Information Systems (IS). The term refers to the integrated and collaborative collection of software-driven information technologies that aid in achieving individual, group, organizational, or societal objectives (Global Text Project, 2007). It applies another discipline of computing which is Information Technology (IT) to collect, store, process, maintain, use, share, disseminate, dispose, display, or transmit information. In my prior knowledge before researching for the portfolio, I knew IS as a social science combined with computing to disseminate information properly, following ethics and privacy. However, I face confusion when differentiating between IT and IS.</p>                
                <p class="paragraph3">The lecture on the topic occurred on August 29, 2024, Thursday and started at 3:00 PM via face-to-face class. The resource person was Ms. Navarrete who discussed “Information Systems: Concepts and Definitions,” joined by students from BS CS, IS, and IT. The topic was not completely new to me since a few components were shared during the first week of orientation. Anyhow, the lecture and portfolio-making provided me with a new set of information especially, on the different types of support systems and the roles set for each. For this topic, the materials were enough for me to understand the overview of what IS is all about that would prepare me for more advanced topics in the following meetings. Moreover, I expected the topic to be about data and information, and how we process them to attain a meaningful and significant context.</p>  
                <p class="paragraph3">As the objectives for the lecture were explained, I am able to differentiate data from information, define IS based on its technology, task, person, and structure, and categorize the support systems of IS. It is complex and interrelated to other disciplines in computing that contributed to a global interaction. By the end of the lecture, I felt equipped with a more nuanced perspective of IS, recognizing it not merely as a technical tool, but as a dynamic field that bridges multiple domains, driving advancements and facilitating global connectivity.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>A number system is a structured method for <b>representing, writing, and expressing numerical values</b> across different dimensions and calculations (Wahed, 2022)</li>
                    <li><b>Every value or number</b> that is inputted, stored, or retrieved from the computer system's memory <b>is associated with a defined number system</b> (Olajide, 2017)</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>The two main types of number systems are (Sinha & Sinha, 2017):</h5>

                                <li>Every symbol represents the same value, no matter where it appears in the number</li>
                                <li>The symbols are merely combined to determine the value of a specific number</li>

                    <li>Representing numbers in different number systems typically requires indicating the <b>base as a subscript</b> (Daffodil International University, 2019)</li>
                    <li>Number systems have evolved in the past (Esmay, 2018). <b>Will they do so again?</b> Many individuals now advocate for using groups of 12 instead of 10. Nevertheless, one fact remains certain: regardless of how numbers are represented, they will always be essential to us</li>

                <p class="paragraph3">The third (3) portfolio on Number Systems occurred on September 3-5, 2024, Tuesday-Thursday and started at 3:00 PM via face-to-face class. The resource person was Ms. Navarrete who lectured on “Number Systems and Number-Base Conversion,” joined by group 10 of CIS 1102N. As a course in line with the program, I am new to the topic and have only encountered a hexadecimal value once during my research for the Programming I class. The Introduction to Computing (ITC) shed light on the objectives and significance of the topic.</p>                
                <p class="paragraph3">From this assignment, which is to research and answer the following questions with valid sources, I found that Number Systems are foundational to both theoretical and practical sub-areas of computing and mathematics. In connection to the previous lesson on the brief history of computing, the figures who have contributed to the discipline have backgrounds in mathematics or research that they applied to their findings or innovations. So, the topic provides the essential ways to represent and process data in various methods in order for it to be a piece of information. As a student majoring in computer science, it is important for me to be able to understand and differentiate the number systems as each has its unique applications and advantages depending on the context in which they are used. It may be for a computational task, digital communication, or human interaction.</p>
                <p class="paragraph3">To come to the point, each number system has its own significance and distinct uses that allow for more efficient problem-solving in both daily tasks and complex technological environments. Each type forms a comprehensive structure that caters to the variety of needs for processing and representation of data. Its relevance in today’s technology signifies its role in advancing the digital world. At its core, the significance of these number systems extends beyond academic interest, it serves as the backbone of modern technology and innovation. The two are necessary as the world progresses in creating increasingly advanced digital tools, and understanding and utilizing these systems leads to their timeless relevance.</p>

The resource person was Ms. Navarrete who provided the key details of the assignment. The components of the computer system: hardware and software were familiar to me, as junior and senior high school computer-related courses have covered the introduction. However, its implementation in the different institutions in the community was not tackled and was new to me. The Introduction to Computing (ITC) course allowed me to deepen my knowledge on the topic.</p>
                <p class="paragraph3">In this assignment, the hardware and software are referred to as the tangible and intangible parts of a system, respectively. The former allows interaction and data processing through a combination of components like the CPU, memory, and input/output devices. Oppositely, the latter instructs hardware on task execution. Moreover, Central Processing Unit (CPU) categories were hard to organize at the beginning since sources used different terms and I struggled with disseminating the information gathered. The diagrams from the sources played a crucial role in helping me organize my thoughts, enabling me to articulate my answers effectively. In connection with the previous lesson, the number systems were utilized to represent and manipulate data within computer systems. Binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal systems are essential for understanding how information is processed at the most basic level, with binary being the fundamental language of computers. These systems allow for efficient data encoding and decoding, facilitating seamless communication between hardware and software components. As a computer science student, I must know the basics of my studies. Understanding the fundamentals of computer science, such as hardware and software components, lays the groundwork for more advanced topics and technologies. It equips me with the knowledge to effectively solve problems and innovate across various domains where computing plays a crucial role.</p>
                <p class="paragraph3">In conclusion, understanding these components and their roles, one can recognize the complex interactions between computer hardware and software, as well as their applications within the various institutions in our daily social interactions. In banks and financial services, there is the Core Banking Software for operations like account management and loan processing. Next, business management chooses appropriate hardware and software for current and future needs. While multimedia combines sound, images, and motion using advanced hardware and software. There is also the defense and military which incorporate software into military systems, enhancing operational strategies and troop morale. Computerization in education has advanced teaching during the pandemic, showcasing the potential of new media. Lastly, medicine has rapid advancements in medical devices that are essential to improve patient conditions with reduced costs and minimally invasive surgeries.</p>

                <h3>PORTFOLIO #5: Comparative Study On Different Types Of Motherboards</h3>
                
                <div class="h4-container">
                    <h4>Introduction</h4>
                </div>
                <p class="paragraph3">In the ever-evolving field of computer technology, choosing the right motherboard form factor is a critical decision that impacts performance, compatibility, and the overall functionality of a system. Form factors now encompass various requirements, including the size, shape, and functionality of the system case; the type, placement, and size of the power supply; the power requirements of the system; the type and location of external connectors; as well as the airflow and cooling systems within the case (Gilster, 2001). The number of options, ranging from Legacy form factors like AT and LPX motherboards to Modern form factors such as ATX, BTX, E-ATX, mATX, Mini-ITX, Mini-ATX, Pico-BTX, and Standard-ATX motherboards, each offer distinct advantages and limitations. This complexity poses a challenge for users attempting to balance their specific needs with the technological capabilities of the chosen motherboard. The problem at hand is determining which motherboard form factor best aligns with individual requirements, considering factors such as the build, CPU slots, memory slots, chipsets, BIOS, PCI slots, SATA, and built-in features, while also navigating through the technological advancements and constraints inherent to each form factor. This fifth portfolio aims to dissect these requirements, providing a comparative study of the different types of motherboards to guide users in making informed decisions tailored to their computing needs.</p>

                <div class="h4-container">
                    <h4>Discussion</h4>
                </div>
                <p class="paragraph3">The form factor comes in four general builds: full-size, mid-size, Small Form Factor (SFF), and unique form factors. AT, ATX, Extended-ATX (E-ATX), and Standard-ATX motherboards are observed to be full-size form factors with a range of 12" W x 9.6" L to 12" W x 13" L. There are also mid-size form factors observed such as the Micro-ATX (mATX) and Mini-ATX motherboards with a range of 9.6" W x 9.6" L to 11.2" W x 8.2" L. Following this, SFF is the LPX, Mini ITX, and Pico BTX motherboards ranging from 6.7" W x 6.7" L to 9" W x 11-13" L. Lastly, BTX motherboard is a unique form factor with a build of 12.8" W x 10.5" L.</p>
                <p class="paragraph3">The CPU slot of the form factors is divided into two types, the legacy and modern form factors. The AT and LPX motherboards are legacy form factors that support older sockets such as sockets 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8, as well as slot 1. On the other hand, modern form factors like ATX, BTX, E-ATX, mATX, Mini-ITX, Mini-ATX, Pico-BTX, and Standard-ATX motherboards support high-performance Intel and AMD processors mostly with Intel’s LGA (775, 1151, 1200, and 1700) and AMD’s AM(2/2+, 4, and 5).</p>
                <p class="paragraph3">The legacy form factors AT and LPX motherboards utilized Single In-line Memory Module (SIMM) slots with 8 or 16 slots for the former and 4 slots for the latter. The modern form factors namely ATX, BTX, E-ATX, mATX, Mini-ITX, Mini-ATX, Pico-BTX, and Standard-ATX motherboards support a maximum of 8 Dual In-line Memory Module (DIMM) slots for DRR memory types.</p>
                <p class="paragraph3">The legacy form factors utilized older chipsets from Intel like the 82311 MCA, 82340 series, 82430FX, 430FX, and VIA 82C586. These chipsets are compatible with early processors such as Pentium and 486. Oppositely, modern form factors support a diverse range of modern chipsets from high-end options of Intel Z790 and AMD X670E to more budget-friendly options like Intel H710 and AMD A620. Moreover, BTX and Pico-BTX include older chipsets like 915G, 945G, X38, X48, 780G, 790GX, and Q965 Express.</p>
                <p class="paragraph3">An older or Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) with limited features is used by the legacy form factors. The increase in complexity and capability of motherboards led to an evolution catering to a wider range of user needs. That is why modern form factors incorporate advanced or modern Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) BIOS.</p>
                <p class="paragraph3">Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) is an older standard still used by legacy form factors like AT and LPX motherboards with a limit to 2-4 PCI slots, often in 8- or 6-bit. Additionally, PCI Express (PCIe) is the modern standard for high-speed expansion slots that are used by modern form factors. It varied in slot size. Larger slots (x16, x8) offer higher bandwidth while smaller slots (x4, x1) are for lower-bandwidth devices. Larger form factors like ATX and E-ATX offer more expansion options, while smaller form factors like Mini-ITX and Pico-BTX have limited slots.</p>
                <p class="paragraph3">Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA) is used by modern form factors to connect to storage devices such as HDDs and SSDs. Pico BTX and E-ATX motherboards have limited SATA ports due to size constraints while Mini ITX motherboard has 2-4 SATA ports despite its compact size. BTX, mATX, Mini-ATX, and Standard-ATX motherboards have 4-6 SATA ports often combined with M.2 slots for NVMe SSDs. There is also a 6-8 SATA ports used by the ATX motherboard. Finally, legacy form factors have No SATA ports and instead use older Parallel Advanced Technology Attachment (PATA) IDE interface.</p>
                <p class="paragraph3">The AT motherboard represents an older form factor with limited built-in features. In contrast, the ATX and E-ATX motherboards are versatile and offer a wide range of features, making them the industry standard for modern builds. The BTX form factor focuses on improving airflow and cooling, although it is less common than ATX. For high-performance needs, the E-ATX form factor provides advanced features and is suitable for high-end systems. Smaller form factors such as LPX, mATX, Mini-ITX, Mini-ATX, and Pico BTX cater to compact builds with varying levels of features, balancing size with functionality to suit different user needs.</p>
